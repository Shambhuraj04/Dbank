# DBank

## Overview
DBank is a decentralized banking application built on the Internet Computer (IC). It allows users to manage their balance, deposit funds (top-up), withdraw funds (debit), check their balance, and even earn compound interest over time. The project consists of two primary components:

1. **Motoko Backend**: A smart contract written in Motoko running on the Internet Computer that handles all the banking logic, including balance updates, transactions, and compound interest.
2. **Frontend (JavaScript)**: A web application that interacts with the Motoko backend, providing users with a simple interface to interact with their bank account.

## Features

- **Top-Up**: Deposit money into your account to increase your balance.
- **Debit (Withdraw)**: Withdraw money from your account, as long as the amount is available.
- **Check Balance**: View the current balance in your account.
- **Compound Interest**: Automatically earn compound interest over time based on the duration your money is in the account.
- **Responsive Frontend**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies

- **Motoko**: The backend smart contract language used for the banking logic on the Internet Computer.
- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS**: The frontend is built with standard web technologies and integrates with the Motoko backend via the Internet Computer SDK.
- **Webpack**: Used for bundling and serving the frontend assets.
- **Internet Computer (IC)**: The decentralized cloud infrastructure on which the DBank canister runs.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or higher)
- [DFX](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/dfx.html) (v0.11.1 or higher)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (for building and serving the frontend)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dbank.git
   cd dbank
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install DFX** (if you haven't already) by following the [DFX installation guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/dfx.html).

4. **Start the local Internet Computer replica**:

   ```bash
   dfx start --background
   ```

5. **Deploy the backend canister**:

   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

6. **Run the frontend**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start a local development server at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Running the Project Locally

Once the canister is deployed, you can interact with the DBank application locally.

1. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
2. Use the provided form to:
   - **Top-Up**: Deposit funds into your account.
   - **Debit**: Withdraw funds from your account.
   - **Check Balance**: View the current balance in your account.
3. Compound interest will be applied automatically based on the time elapsed since the last compounding.

## Notes

- This project uses **Motoko** for backend canister logic, and **JavaScript** for frontend logic. The frontend interacts with the backend using the Internet Computer's **Candid** interface.
- Compound interest is automatically calculated and applied to your account balance.
- The frontend updates the account balance in real-time as you interact with the bank.

### Frontend Environment Variables

If you are hosting the frontend code outside of the DFX environment, you may need to adjust the following:

- Set `NODE_ENV` to `production` if you're using Webpack for production builds.
- Use your own method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in autogenerated declarations.


## Acknowledgements

- **Motoko**: The backend programming language used for writing the banking smart contract.
- **Internet Computer SDK**: The SDK that enables the creation and deployment of canisters to the Internet Computer.
- **Webpack**: Used to bundle and serve frontend assets.
